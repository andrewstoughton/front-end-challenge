React, Webpack, Babel.

Code fetches all data for patients, activities and patient summaries.

React components created for Patient and Summary.

Features a Filter button to render out patients Not meeting the required amount of physical activity.

Each patient has a link to view a patient summary showing patient details and activities.


Would like to improve on the presentation of data by displaying a percentage of the patient's activity above and below the threshold.

And add a few more sorting and filtering views - eg. by gender.
